## üéØ Overview

**Promotion Recommendation System** is a data-driven project that helps e-commerce platforms decide *which promotions to offer* and *to whom*, in order to maximize conversions, customer satisfaction, and long-term value. It leverages transactional data and click-stream behavior to generate personalized, timely, and optimally-priced promotion suggestions.

## üìÇ Project Structure

| Folder / File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `data_generator/` | Simulates or creates synthetic data (transactions, clicks, etc.) for testing and modeling. |
| `data_consumer/` | Processes and ingests raw data; performs cleaning, feature engineering. |
| `promotion_engine/` | Core logic / models that assess candidate promotions, compute uplift, select optimal promotions. |
| `inventory_dashboard/` / `dashboard/` | Visualization tools / UI to monitor inventory, promotion effectiveness, metrics. |
| `app.py` | Main application entry point (API endpoints / server). |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Setup for containers / orchestration for local development / deployment. |
| `env/` | Environment configuration files (e.g. variables, secrets, settings). |

## üîç Key Features

- **Personalization:** Tailors promotions based on individual customer behavior rather than ‚Äúone-size-fits-all.‚Äù  
- **Uplift modeling / A/B testing readiness:** Estimates incremental effect of promotions.  
- **Real-time or near-real-time recommendations:** Reacts to recent activity (clicks, carts, inventory changes).  
- **Inventory sensitivity:** Ensures promotions align with stock levels to avoid overselling.  
- **Dashboard & Visualization:** Monitor promotion performance and relevant KPIs in one place.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the project**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ok4ysarthak/Promotion-Recomendation-System.git
   cd Promotion-Recomendation-System
   
2. Set up environment
```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure settings
   ```
   Edit .env or files in env/ to supply configuration (e.g. DB credentials, API keys, thresholds).

5. Generate or load data
   ```
   Either use the data_generator/ to simulate data or load your real transactional / clickstream datasets.

6. Run promotion engine
   ```
   python app.py

7. Launch dashboards / monitor
   ```
   Run dashboard modules to visualize inventory, promotions performance, customers metrics, etc.
