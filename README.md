## üéØ Overview

**Promotion Recommendation System** is a data-driven project that helps e-commerce platforms decide *which promotions to offer* and *to whom*, in order to maximize conversions, customer satisfaction, and long-term value. It leverages transactional data and click-stream behavior to generate personalized, timely, and optimally-priced promotion suggestions.
